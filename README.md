Created By: Shaxowfall (me, myself & I) <br>----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
A small scale converter made in js with the sole purpose of adding a level of obscurity to inputted strings content.<br>----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
If you seem to find an error/fatal error that is not caused by user mis-input(unless said input is a string but still cannot be processed), contact me via the issues section for this repository
