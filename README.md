# CONV.js
Created By: Shaxowfall (me, myself & I) <br>----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
A small scale converter made in js with the sole purpose of adding a level of obscurity to inputted strings content.<br>----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Known Issues: Cannot Convert Characters With Identifier Codes(CharCodes) Above 999, However Soon I Will Fix That Issue With An Automatic Length Detector.<br>----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
If you seem to find an error/fatal error that is not caused by user mis-input(unless said input is a string but still cannot be processed), contact me via the issues section for this repository
